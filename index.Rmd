### What is the body mass index (BMI)

- - -

<q>a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.</q> - Wikipedia

- - -

The BMI is used in a wide variety of contexts as a simple method to
assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is
normal or desirable for a person of his or her height.

Stastistical BMI data is readily available for comparison

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv("UnitedStatesofAmerica.csv")[c(40:43), c(1:6)]
colnames(df)[1] <- "year"
ggplot(data=melt(df, id = "year"), aes(x=year, y=value, fill=variable)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Percentage of adults in the US") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of BMI classes over time")
```
